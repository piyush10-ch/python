name,age="Piyush chaudhary",23
print(name,age)
#print("hello" +" "+ name+"your age is"+" "+age)error because we cannot print int value with string so we make age string with help of double quotes
age="23"
print("hello"+" "+name+" "+ age)
x=y=z=2
print(x+y+z)#here we can also declare values in 3 variables
